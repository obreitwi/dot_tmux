# .tmux.conf

Make tmux behave more like screen.

This is my personal tmux setup. Most notably it changes the modifier key from
`<c-b>`  to `<c-a>` to make it more
[screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html)-like.

## Install

Requires [PyDEMX](https://github.com/obreitwi/pydemx).
```
pydemx tmux.conf.pydemx
```
