# .tmux.conf

Make tmux behave more like screen.

This is my personal tmux setup. Most notable changes:

* Move modifier key from `<c-b>`  to `<c-a>` to make config more
[screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html)-like.

* Toggle mouse-mode via `<c-a>`+`m`.

## Install

```
PREFIX=<path in ${PATH}> ./install.sh
```
